# Guideline

This is a basic arbiscan scrapper with given contract address search.

Things you'll need:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)


## Step to Follow

> navigate to application directory and install dependencies run using following command in cmd `npm install`

> to execute the code scrapper run following command in cmd in the root directly of the application `node scraper.js`

> to check the reciever token id you can run  `node recieverTokenCount.js`

## TODO List

> Scaper is currenly navigating through all pages regardless we have data already download or not. best way it to check the change and update the new record
> web server to accept token address dynamically.
> scheduler is not implemented
